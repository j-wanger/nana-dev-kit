<!-- Canonical reviewer checklist -- 2026-04-10 -->
<!-- REFERENCE, DO NOT PASTE. Each reviewer-prompt.md should link here for the 13 standard checks. -->
<!-- Skills that use this checklist: wiki-bootstrap, wiki-absorb, wiki-reorg, wiki-add (partial -- capture mode only uses format compliance subset) -->

# Standard Reviewer Validation Checks

These 13 checks are common across all wiki reviewer prompts. Perform ALL of them unless the skill's reviewer-prompt.md explicitly says to skip specific checks.

**IMPORTANT -- Wiki Path:** The Runtime Context will include a `### Wiki Path` field containing the absolute path to the target wiki directory. All file paths below use `<wiki_path>` as a placeholder. Replace it with the actual path from Runtime Context when reading or writing files.

## CRITICAL: Do Not Trust the Report

The writer's report may contain errors or omissions. You MUST independently verify by reading the actual files on disk. Do not assume the report is accurate.

---

## Check 1: Frontmatter Completeness

Read each article file listed in the writer's report. Verify ALL required fields are present and valid:

| Field | Required | Valid Values |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| title | yes | Non-empty string |
| aliases | yes | Array (can be empty []) |
| category | yes | One of: concepts, patterns, decisions, action-plans |
| tags | yes | Array of lowercase hyphenated strings |
| parents | yes | Array of filenames (can be empty [] for roots) |
| created | yes | ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| updated | yes | ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| source | yes | One of: session, ingest, synthesize, bootstrap, consolidated (skill-specific -- see reviewer-prompt.md for which value(s) are valid) |
| tier | yes | `public` or `private` (validated in detail by Check 11) |
| status | yes | `draft`, `reviewed`, `verified`, `stale`, or `archived` (validated in detail by Check 12) |

Flag any missing field, empty required field, or invalid value.

## Check 2: Cross-links in Related Section

Every article MUST have at least one `[[cross-link]]` in its Related section. Check:
- The `## Related` section exists
- It contains at least one `[[filename|Display Text]]` link
- Links use the correct format (no path prefixes -- `[[my-article]]` not `[[patterns/my-article]]`)

## Check 3: Parents in Both Places

For every article with non-empty `parents` in frontmatter:
- Each parent filename in `parents: [...]` MUST also appear as a `[[parent-filename|...]]` link in the Related section
- Each parent link in Related MUST be annotated with `-- parent topic`

## Check 4: Article Size

No article may exceed 120 lines. Count the actual lines of each file. If any article exceeds 120 lines, flag it and recommend splitting.

## Check 5: Bidirectional Links

For every cross-link found:
- If article B links to article A in its Related section, article A MUST link back to article B
- Read both files to verify bidirectionality
- Flag any one-way links

## Check 6: Filename Uniqueness

Collect all article filenames across ALL category subdirectories:
- `<wiki_path>/articles/concepts/`
- `<wiki_path>/articles/patterns/`
- `<wiki_path>/articles/decisions/`
- `<wiki_path>/articles/action-plans/`

No two articles may share the same filename, even in different subdirectories.

## Check 7: Index Reflects All Articles

Read `<wiki_path>/index.md`. Verify:
- Every article on disk appears in the By Category section under its correct category
- Every article on disk appears in the By Hierarchy section (rooted or as a child)
- The Recent section contains the last 10 articles by updated date, newest first
- No phantom entries (articles listed in index but not on disk)

## Check 8: Schema Proposals Are Append-Only

Read `<wiki_path>/schema.md`. Verify:
- The `## Custom Tags` section is unchanged from before the operation
- The `## Hierarchy Roots` section is unchanged from before the operation
- Any new proposals appear ONLY in `## Proposed Changes`
- Proposals follow the format:
  - `- [YYYY-MM-DD] Add tag: {{tag}} (used by N articles)`
  - `- [YYYY-MM-DD] New hierarchy root candidate: {{name}} (N articles, no parent)`

**Exception:** wiki-reorg has explicit authority to update `## Custom Tags` and `## Hierarchy Roots` directly when the user has approved changes. For wiki-reorg, check 8 is replaced by "Schema Matches Structure" (see wiki-reorg reviewer-prompt.md).

## Check 9: Log Entry

Read `<wiki_path>/log.md`. Verify:
- A new line was appended (not prepended, not replacing existing)
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS] OPERATION -- summary with counts`
- The OPERATION name matches the skill (BOOTSTRAP, ABSORB, REORG, SYNTHESIZE, etc.)
- Counts match the actual number of created and updated articles

## Check 10: File Count Matches Plan

Count the number of article files the writer created or modified. Compare against the analyst's plan:
- The analyst plan specifies N articles to create/update
- The writer's output should produce exactly N new/updated articles (not more, not less)
- If the count mismatches, flag as HIGH: "Writer produced M files but analyst planned N. Possible slug migration orphans or missing articles."

This check catches the [[writer-subagent-slug-migration-anti-pattern]]: writers that rename analyst-determined slugs mid-pass without deleting the old file, producing orphan drafts.

## Check 11: Tier Validity

Every article must have a `tier` field in its frontmatter with a value of exactly `public` or `private`. See `content-model.md` for the canonical tier definitions.

- Missing `tier` field: flag as ERROR
- Invalid value (anything other than `public` or `private`): flag as ERROR

Episodic entries (files in `episodic/`) are NOT articles and are exempt from this check.

Severity: **ERROR**

## Check 12: Status Validity

Every article must have a `status` field in its frontmatter with one of: `draft`, `reviewed`, `verified`, `stale`, `archived`. See `content-model.md` for the canonical lifecycle state machine.

- Missing `status` field: flag as ERROR
- Invalid value: flag as ERROR

Severity: **ERROR**

## Check 13: Claims Validation

If the article has a `claims:` array in frontmatter or `[[clm_*]]` markers in the body:

1. Every `[[clm_*]]` marker in the body must have a matching entry in the `claims:` array (by `id` field)
2. Every entry in the `claims:` array must have a corresponding `[[clm_*]]` marker in the body
3. Claim IDs must match the format `clm_<6-char-alphanumeric>`

Flag orphaned body markers (in body but not frontmatter) as ERROR.
Flag orphaned frontmatter entries (in frontmatter but not body) as WARNING.

If the article has no claims at all (no frontmatter array and no body markers), this check passes automatically.

Severity: **ERROR** (orphaned body markers) / **WARNING** (orphaned frontmatter entries)

## Output Format

```
Score: N/13
Issues:
- [check name]: [specific issue -- what's wrong and how to fix it]
Suggestions:
- Consider: [improvement worth noting but not blocking]
Verdict: accept | revise | reject
```

Score-to-verdict mapping:
- Score 10-13: Verdict must be `accept`
- Score 6-9: Verdict must be `revise`
- Score 1-5: Verdict must be `reject`

If there are no issues, write `Issues: none`.

Be specific. Name the file, the field, and the exact problem. Do not give vague feedback like "some links are missing." Say which article is missing which link.
