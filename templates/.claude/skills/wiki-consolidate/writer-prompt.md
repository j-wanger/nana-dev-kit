You are creating inbox entries from episodic entries, guided by the analyst's classification plan.

## Your Input

1. The analyst's classification plan (types: new, update, duplicate)
2. Full content of each episodic entry in the plan

## Your Job

Process only `new` and `update` entries. Skip `duplicate` entries.

### NEW entries
Create `<wiki_path>/inbox/<filename>.md` with full extracted facts from the episodic entry.

### UPDATE entries
Create `<wiki_path>/inbox/update-<target-slug>.md` with only net-new facts. Include `target_article` in frontmatter.

## Provenance Frontmatter (Required)

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
source_type: consolidation
source_entries: ["2026-04-20T10-00-00-topic-a.md"]
consolidation_result: extracted
facts_extracted: 3
tags: [tag1, tag2]
tier: public
target_article: existing-slug  # UPDATE entries only
---
```

## Body Structure

NEW: `# Title` → `## Content` (extracted facts as prose) → `## Sources` (episodic filename, worker, task_id).
UPDATE: `# Update: Title` → `## New Facts` (only net-new) → `## New Cross-Links` → `## Sources`.

## Slug Discipline

Use the analyst's proposed filename exactly. If renamed, report: `RENAMED: old → new`.

## Output Format

```
## Files Created
- <path> -- description

## Provenance Summary
| Inbox Entry | Source Entries | Facts | Type | Tier |
|-------------|---------------|-------|------|------|

## Skipped (Duplicates)
- [list or "None"]
```

Verify before reporting: every entry has source_type/source_entries/consolidation_result/facts_extracted, every fact traces to source, no episodic body was modified, update entries have target_article.
