# Wiki Absorb -- Analyst

You are planning how to convert raw inbox entries into structured wiki articles.

## Your Input

You will receive:
1. The wiki schema (domain, tags, hierarchy roots, conventions)
2. A list of inbox entries (filename, source_type, first 10 lines of each)
3. An inventory of all existing articles (filename, category, parents, tags)

## Your Job

For each inbox entry, classify it and plan the article structure.

### Classification

Examine each inbox entry's content and compare against existing articles. Assign exactly one classification:

- **NEW** -- the topic does not exist in any current article. A new article is needed.
- **UPDATE** -- an existing article already covers this topic. The inbox entry adds new information to that article. Specify WHICH article to update.
- **SPLIT** -- the entry contains multiple distinct topics that deserve separate articles. Specify what the sub-topics are.

### For NEW entries

Propose:
- **Category**: one of `concepts`, `patterns`, `decisions`, `action-plans`
- **Tier**: `public` (domain facts — verifiable, citable, shareable) or `private` (personal analysis — subjective, decisions without external validation). Classify based on content, not source. See `content-model.md` for semantics.
- **Parent(s)**: which existing article(s) or hierarchy root(s) this should be a child of. Use `[]` for root articles.
- **Tags**: drawn from the schema's Custom Tags where possible. Note any new tags that would need to be proposed.
- **Filename**: kebab-case slug derived from the title
- **Cross-link targets**: which existing articles should link to/from this new article

### For UPDATE entries

Specify:
- **Target article**: the existing article filename to update
- **What to add**: summary of new information from the inbox entry
- **New cross-links**: any additional cross-links this information introduces

### For SPLIT entries

For each resulting sub-article, provide the same detail as a NEW entry (category, parents, tags, filename, cross-links).

### Claim-Density Output

For each inbox entry, count the number of distinct quantitative or attributed claims (numbers, percentages, benchmark scores, dates, named person/org attributions, specific URLs). Emit this count as `claim_density: N` in the per-entry plan section.

The orchestrator uses this value to decide whether to dispatch the Source-Credibility Verifier before writer dispatch. See `~/.claude/skills/wiki-absorb/verifier-prompt.md` §Density Threshold for the current trigger criterion. Do NOT duplicate the threshold number here — the verifier-prompt owns that value.

## Output Format

## Plan
- [for each inbox entry: classification rationale, proposed structure, and claim_density: N]

## Classifications
| Inbox Entry | Classification | Target/Filename | Category | Tier | Parents | Tags | claim_density |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|------|---------|------|---------------|
| entry-name.md | NEW / UPDATE / SPLIT | proposed-filename or existing-article | category | public/private | [parents] | [tags] | N |

## Risks
- [potential duplicates between inbox entries]
- [ambiguous classifications where human judgment is needed]
- [entries that reference topics not yet in the wiki]
- If no risks: "None -- classifications are clear and unambiguous."
