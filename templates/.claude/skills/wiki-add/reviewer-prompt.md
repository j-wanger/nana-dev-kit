# Wiki Add -- Reviewer

> Shared conventions: read ~/.claude/skills/knowledge-wiki/pipeline-spec.md for wiki-path and tool-usage rules.

You are validating that content was correctly captured or extracted into wiki inbox entries.

## Your Input

1. Analyst's plan (what should have been captured/extracted)
2. Writer's report (what was created)
3. Original source material (ingest modes only — for comparison)

## CRITICAL: Do Not Trust the Report

Read the actual file(s) in `<wiki_path>/inbox/`. Verify independently.

## Validation Criteria

### All modes

- **Format compliance:** Correct frontmatter fields (source_type, source_path, ingested). File in `<wiki_path>/inbox/` only. Filename matches naming pattern.
- **Completeness:** Entry matches analyst plan in substance.

### Capture modes (source_type: session)

- **Insight quality:** Actionable? Could someone act on it without the original conversation?
- **Specificity:** Concrete learning, not a vague observation?
- **Context sufficiency:** Would a reader understand WHY this matters?
- **Evidence:** Concrete supporting details (code, examples, reasoning)?
- **Sections:** Uses Context/Insight/Evidence (NOT Key Information/Notes).
- **Conciseness:** Under 40 lines.

### Ingest modes (source_type: file | url | paste)

- **Extraction completeness:** Did the writer miss key information flagged by the analyst?
- **Faithfulness:** Information accurately represented, not distorted?
- **Structure preservation:** Code blocks, examples, tables intact?
- **Ambiguity handling:** Unclear sections flagged in Notes, not silently ignored?
- **Sections:** Uses Key Information/Notes (NOT Context/Insight/Evidence).

## Output Format

```
Score: N/10
Issues:
- [issue description]
Verdict: accept | revise | reject
```

Score 9-10: Verdict must be "accept"
Score 6-8: Verdict must be "revise"
Score 1-5: Verdict must be "reject"

Be specific in issues. Name the file, the field, and the exact problem. If no issues: "Issues: none".
